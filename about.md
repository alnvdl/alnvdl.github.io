<h2>About me</h2>

I'm Allan Vidal, a software engineer located in Brazil. I usually work with
Python, Go, C/C++ and JavaScript, both in backend and frontend projects.

View my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/alnvdl).

I also have a separate [work GitHub profile](https://github.com/alnvdl-work),
but most activity takes place privately there.
